I am obsessed with my dog, a 17 lbs Shiba Inu, Jalebi.

My wife and I have tattoos of her. Ask me for mine when you see me.

In the last couple of months, I've gotten into sewing and aim to have all of my wardrobe be self made.
I love swing dancing, Muay Thai and cooking. My desire to have this be the year of the six pack is always offset by my desire to have this be the year of Nachos, Cakes and burgers.

In my previous professional lives, I've worked on OData, Azure HDInsight and a brief-lived experiment called Windows Phone, at Microsoft. Just before joining GitHub, I worked at SUSE/HPE building a [CI/CD system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpRBFUxOt60), from the ground up, and [SUSE Container Platform](https://www.suse.com/products/caas-platform/)  to run a Kubernetes-based PaaS on SUSE Linux.
